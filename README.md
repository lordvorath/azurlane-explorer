# AzurLane Explorer

This is a python command line utility to explore the Azur Lane character roster and experiment with team combinations.

It will eventually (probably) include:

[] A scraping utility to get/update data from the [Azur Lane Wiki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Azur_Lane_Wiki)
[] A Random Team Generator with various settings
[] A query/search utility to help you find the right ship.
[] A DPS calculator (very rough)
